# Mobalytics-Gaming-Market-Research
This project is an externship focused on analyzing gaming genres and providing insights to Mobalytics as they explore new market expansion opportunities. I conducted in-depth research on gaming genres, player psychology, and game revenue models. I analyzed the brand positioning and communication sentiment, perform competitor research by engaging with specific games, and present their findings to Mobalytics.
